<small>Imagine a world where you rarely leave home, have little separation between your work and home life, have lost track of time, and haven't quite mastered a regular sleep cycle. __Great, I'm right there with you.__</small>

## Can we measure sleep quality?

```{r visualizing-sleep-statistics, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=11, warning=FALSE}
suppressWarnings({
  get_sleep_data(root = here::here(), rolling_average_window = 7) %>%
    dplyr::filter(dt >= "2019-10-01") %>%
    ggplot2::ggplot() +
    ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(x=dt, y=sleep_score)) +
    ggplot2::xlab("Date") + 
    ggplot2::ylab("Fitness Tracker Sleep Score") +
    ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight() 
})
```

<small>With a fitness tracker, we have an imperfect proxy.  **At first glance, it looks like there is a shift in late March, were there any major changes?**  If we identify a potential cause, can estimate how much it has affected sleep quality?</small>

## Oh right...

## What was the impact of the 'treatment'?

What are our limitations?<br>

1. We only have historical data for a single subject
2. Too expensive to recreate an experiment
3. Time travel not yet available

.pull-bottom[
**Our challenge:** We need to estimate the outcome as if the 'treatment' never occurred. (i.e., the counterfactual `Y(0)`)

## Estimate `Y(0)` with `CausalImpact`

![](./img/complex-example.png)

`CausalImpact` is an R package for causal inference using Bayesian structural time-series models.

???

Try to predict the counterfactual, `Y(0)` given:

- response time series `Y(1)` (e.g., clicks)
- set of control time series (e.g., clicks in unaffected markets or sites)
- known period of intervention.

Does so with a _Bayesian structural time-series model_ to predict what would have happened if the intervention had never occurred.

Assumptions

- there is a set control time series that were themselves not affected by the intervention
- that the relationship between covariates and treated time series, as established during the pre-period, remains stable throughout the post-period

```{r creating-inputs, fig.height=4, fig.width=10}
library(zoo); set.seed(1);

x1 <- 100 + arima.sim(model = list(ar = 0.999), n = 100)
y  <- 1.2 * (x1) + rnorm(100)     
y[71:100] <- y[71:100] + 10
time.points <- seq.Date(as.Date("2020-01-01"), by = 1, length.out = 100)
data <- zoo::zoo(cbind(y, x1), time.points)

zoo::autoplot.zoo(data, facets = NULL)
```

---

```{r, visualizing-impact, fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
pre  <- as.Date(c("2020-01-01", "2020-03-11"))  
post <- as.Date(c("2020-03-12", "2020-04-09"))  

impact <- CausalImpact(data, pre, post)
plot(impact)
```

---

```{r, summary-of-impact}
summary(impact)
```

---

## What about the sleep data and weather covariates?

```{r echo=FALSE}
sleep_data <- get_sleep_data_for_causal_impact(here::here(), 7)
zoo::autoplot.zoo(sleep_data)
```

---

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=10, image-impact-two}
pre  <- as.Date(c("2019-09-04", "2020-03-27"))
post <- as.Date(c("2020-03-28", "2020-09-02"))

sleep_impact_march_28 <- CausalImpact(sleep_data, pre, post)
plot(sleep_impact_march_28)
```

---

```{r, summary-of-impact-two}
summary(sleep_impact_march_28)
```


---

## Inconclusive? Some popular reasons...

1. There was no impact.
2. The true 'treatment' occurred at another time.
3. An 'inappropriate' prior was chosen.
4. Multiple, 'treatments' occurred in same time period.
5. Reliance on too few covariates (spurious correlation overtook model)
6. Covariant time-series are not correlated with target `pre-period`

.bottom[
  __In the case of the sleep quality data, all four are potentially true.__

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, image-impact-three}
pre  <- as.Date(c("2019-09-04", "2020-03-15"))
post <- as.Date(c("2020-03-16", "2020-09-02"))

sleep_impact_march_16 <- CausalImpact(sleep_data, pre, post)
plot(sleep_impact_march_16)
```
Let's pick another period...WFH started March 16

---

### What is the impact now?

```{r, summary-of-impact-three}
summary(sleep_impact_march_16)
```

---

## TLDR;

This technique sensitive to the selected period, priors, and covariates.

## Under the hood


A state space model, defined by an observation equation (1), linking observed data $$y_{t}$$ to a latent state $$\alpha_{t}$$ over time. And a state equation (2), dictating the change in state $$\alpha_{t}$$ over time.

$$y_{t} = Z_{t}^{T} \alpha_{t} + \epsilon_{t}$$

$$\alpha_{t+1} = T_{t}\alpha_{t} + R_{t}\eta_{t}$$
